Whats new in Castor 1.1

- Class Coroutine and macros co_begin, co_end, col_return, co_yield.
- Relations writeAll and writeAllTo to print write all elements in a sequence to cout or to a stream.
- Relation eq_mem - for unifying with non static data members.
- Relations write_mem and writeTo_mem to print value of a data member to cout or a stream.
- Relations eval and eval_mf.
- Relations unique_mf and unique_mem
- New Named-ILEs : call, call_mf, get and ref.
- Signatures for eq_f and eq_mf modified and more overloads added.
- Overloads enhancements to relations that take functions or member functions as argument. This
  allows passing the name of an *overloaded* function (or method) to these relations without 
  explicit disambiguation. Also arguments to be forwarded can be POTs or lrefs :
  + Additional overloads for eq_f, eq_mf, predicate_f, predicate_mf, writeAll_f and writeAll_mf.
  + Signatures for eq_f, predicate_f and writeAll_f modified (new signatures continue to be backward compatible).

Bug fixes:
- Relations head_n and tail_n now fail instead of throwing exception if n>seq_.size()
- UnifyL  ... had a const member relation preventing copy construction
- Data member Read_r<T>::in (i.e input stream) is now a pointer instead of a reference to allow copy assignment of Read_r.
- Added #include <cstring.h> in eq.h  (Thanks to David Côme)


Deprecated:
In order to use the following deprecated facilites a #define CASTOR_ENABLE_DEPRECATED is required.
- Named ILE Create::with - use create() instead.
- Class OneSolutionRelation - use class Coroutine instead.

testing:
------------
test ILEs with const objects

todo
------------
Tabling support
CutAnd needs support for readonly relations
Aggregates (count, sum, sort )

Since we now know both An and Pn we can decide wether to use effective value or pass directly (function objects case may be tricky)
Implement head_n, head_tail etc. in terms of views instead of lists.
Look into perfect forwarding issues with create

Simple Ones:
Update example in eq_mem ref manual to use sum()
Undo commenting out of to error(char*)
