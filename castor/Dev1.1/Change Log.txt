Whats new in Castor 1.1

- OneSolution relation is now deprecated. use custom_relation
- class custom_relation and coroutine macros rel_begin, rel_end, rel_return, rel_yield
- writeAll and writeAllTo  (**need docs and tests)


Bug fixes:
- head_n and tail_n now fails instead of throwing exception if n>seq_.size()
- UnifyL  ... had a const member relation preventing copy construction
- Data member Read_r<T>::in is now a pointer instead of a reference to allow assignment of Read_r.
- fixed #include of header ??
