Whats new in Castor 1.1

- OneSolution relation is now deprecated. use Coroutine
- Class Coroutine and macros co_begin, co_end, co_return & co_yield that support coroutine style programming
- I/O relations writeAll and writeAllTo to write collections and iterators bound sequences to console or ostreams.
    : Must ensure the stream exists when evaluation occurs.


Bug fixes:
- head_n and tail_n now fails instead of throwing exception if n>seq_.size()
- UnifyL  ... had a const member relation preventing copy construction
- Data member Read_r<T>::in is now a pointer instead of a reference to allow assignment of Read_r.
- Added #include of cstring.h in eq.h  (Thanks to David Côme)
